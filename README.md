# Practical Project- Camouflage Worms

## Project information

OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) is a retinal imaging technique that has gained significant attention in the medical field. Through the analysis of scanned images, researchers can identify the patterns of specific diseases. However, due to limitations in current technology, the generated images often contain substantial noise, and the differentiation of neural layers is not distinctly clear. 

The objective of this project is to develop a method that processes these scanned images in a manner that reduces noise and enhances the clarity of layer distinctions. In this study, multiple Bezier curves are employed to overlay the target image. These curves can adjust their position, size, and color through a defined cost function and an evolutionary algorithm. This approach enables precise placement at the layer-to-layer junctions and effectively masks the noise in areas with less detail, thereby enhancing image clarity.

Details can be found in CITS4404 Assignment2.pdf.
